# Meatcheckr

An autocomplete script that returns when it's safe to eat meat you just opened.

Essential, clearly. Made to practice my Object Oriented JavaScript

### Dependancies
- SASS: From a mac run: `gem install sass`, or go to the [sass site](http://sass-lang.com/install) for more options.

## How to run
1. From the repo location run: `npm install ; gulp`
2. Go to `localhost:3000` on your fave browser.
3. Search for meat. Amazeballs.

## Todo
 - Pass list, appendTo and a classPrefix arg 
 to a config object, instead of as seperate arguments
 - Add something like requirejs to manage scripts
 - Load meat feed as proper JSON
 - Throw a new SVG icon in the design once a match is returned
