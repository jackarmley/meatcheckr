# Meatcheckr

An autocomplete script that returns when it's safe to eat meat you just opened.

Essential, clearly. Made to practice my Object Oriented JavaScript

## Todo
 - Pass list, appendTo and a classPrefix arg 
 to a config object, instead of as seperate arguments
 - Add something like requirejs to manage scripts
 - Load meat feed as proper JSON
 - Throw a new SVG icon in the design once a match is returned
